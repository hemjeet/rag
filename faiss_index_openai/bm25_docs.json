If the designer is using nominal values and the nominal stress equation, $\\sigma_{nom} = P/A$ (as in the previous example), determine what design factor should be used so that the stress does not exceed the strength. - Solution There are two hidden factors to consider here. The first, due to the possibility of eccentric loading, the maximum stress *is not* $\\sigma = P/A$ (review Chap. 3). Second, the person may not be placing the weight onto the rod support end *gradually*, and the load application would then be considered dynamic.",

Let $e = k_e d$ , where $k_e$ is a constant. Thus, Eq.

If a weight is dropped from a height, h, from the support end, the maximum load in the rod is given by Eq.

Since the person is not dropping the weight, h = 0, and with W = P, then F = 2P. This assumes the person is *not* gradually placing the weight on, and there is no damping in the rod. Thus Eq.
